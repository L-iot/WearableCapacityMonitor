Upload the sketch to your arduino (pro mini). 
You can use @miaoski's code for debugging and making sure your
magspoof circuit works (just be aware that the digital pins used his code are different numbers).

Use the softpot test file to calibrate your magazine by putting an increasing number of rounds into the magazine
and recording the analog readings and moving them into the 1d array in the arduino code.

Reference the diagram in this repo or in @miaoski's magspoof repo to make sure that your circuit is right.
I used 24 AWG wire to make the coil for data transfer.
