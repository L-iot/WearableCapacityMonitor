Solid Modeling Files
----------------
Note that this assembly simply represents a proof of concept and has not been designed to fulfill any practical purpose.

It seems that the Raspberry Pi model (and only that model) does not want to load properly when the STEP or IGES file is imported. If you want to place it into the assembly again, I have a folder with only that model in it here. I got it from https://grabcad.com/library/raspberry-pi-3-6

I had to modify the lower receiver to fit the Qi Wireless Charging Ciruit and the Magnetic card reader in a semi-acceptable fashion.
In this assembly, the lower receiver is a modified (read: has sections manually and physically cut away with a power tool) version of the New Frontier LW-15 Polymer Lower Receiver (https://newfrontierarmory.com/shop/lw-15-complete-polymer-lower-receiver/). 

**ONE REALLY IMPORTANT NOTE:**
-----------------------------
I chose this receiver because polymer is easier to cut and because it was a relatively cheap receiver, and **ABOVE ALL**, because *the serial number is located away from where the modifcations take place, and none of the 3d Printed attached parts obfuscate it.*

The serial number is near the fire selector lever, and is not on the exterior of the magazine well like you will find on many other AR-15 lower receivers.

It's a really big deal that you don't alter or cover up the serial number in any way at all if you have bought a lower receiver that has such a serial number associated with it. If you have completed an 80% complete polymer lower yourself, then it's not a problem since there is no serial number assigned to it.

This is the responsibility of you as the person who is modifying their rifle, not mine. Fair warning.
