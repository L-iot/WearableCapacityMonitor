Solid Modeling Files
----------------

I would recommend using the .STEP file as it is likely the most hassle free method of importing the assembly and is the only one that I can confirm imports without issues.

Note that this assembly simply represents a proof of concept and has not been designed to fulfill any practical purpose.

I had to modify the lower receiver to fit the Qi Wireless Charging Ciruit and the Magnetic card reader in a semi-acceptable fashion.
In this assembly, the lower receiver is a modified (read: has sections manually and physically cut away with a power tool) version of the New Frontier LW-15 Polymer Lower Receiver (https://newfrontierarmory.com/shop/lw-15-complete-polymer-lower-receiver/). 

**ONE REALLY IMPORTANT NOTE:**
-----------------------------
I chose this receiver because polymer is easier to cut and because it was a relatively cheap receiver, and **ABOVE ALL**, because *the serial number is located away from where the modifcations take place, and none of the 3d Printed attached parts obfuscate it.*

The serial number is near the fire selector lever, and is not on the exterior of the magazine well like you will find on many other AR-15 lower receivers.

It's a really big deal that you don't alter or cover up the serial number in any way at all if you have bought a lower receiver that has such a serial number associated with it. If you have completed an 80% complete polymer lower yourself, then it's not a problem since there is no serial number assigned to it.

This is the responsibility of you as the person who is modifying their rifle, not mine. Fair warning.
