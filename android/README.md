I ran out of time to really make a competent application for android (First time android developer, here).
The current android-wear program has only been tested on my Moto 360 sport and has no menu to select the Bluetooth address of the raspberry pi
to which it connects.
This means that the mac address of the pi is hardcoded (gasp) into the program and you need to change it build it yourself. This is
pretty much a vital feature that is missing from the app.

Ideas for improvement (on android-wear):
----------------------------------
- 1. The ability to swipe between several screens which would contain some of the below features
- 2. Bluetooth Address selection screen
- 3. Day/Night mode (on an options screen)
- 4. Power down option for rapsberry pi on options screen (requires alteration to the pi's python program)
- 5. Move the connect/disconnect button to it's own screen and auto-navigate to the capacity value display screen on connection
